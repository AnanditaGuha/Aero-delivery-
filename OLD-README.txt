# Aero-delivery-
Big Picture
It is a delivery system, using a drone-like object, that has a built in camera and what is does is it can deliver anything; something light specifically, depending on how big the object is. 

Round 1: 

First steps: to know what I am delivering and where I am delivering to, in terms of coordinates.
ask user: what to deliver and where to go?
Then we will simulate it with turtle (turtle will take the package, drop it off, leave a text where the package is and then go back home)

Testing Plan:

user is asked what to deliver and then is asked where to deliver and gives us coordinates of (100,100)
then, open turtle window and move up right and then see the word pizza there and then goes back home (0,0)
^this will be repeated for the next delivery, depending on the location
